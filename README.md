# Meet - Progressive Web App for Online and Offline Event Management

Meet is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to manage events seamlessly both online and offline. Users can log in using Google's OAuth, access their Google Calendar events, and interact with a user-friendly interface. The application also includes visual representations of data through graphs and charts. Extensive testing has been implemented using technologies such as Google's Puppeteer, JEST, and Cucumber Gherkin.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Recharts**: A composable charting library for React.
- **Google OAuth**: Authentication protocol used for user login.
- **Puppeteer**: A Node library that provides a high-level API to control headless browsers or full browsers over the DevTools Protocol.
- **JEST**: A JavaScript testing framework for React applications.
- **Cucumber Gherkin**: A behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that allows developers to write tests in a natural language style.
